\chapter{Third-Party Code and Libraries}

%If you have made use of any third party code or software libraries, i.e. any code that you have not designed and written yourself, then you must include this appendix. As has been said in lectures, it is acceptable and likely that you will make use of third-party code and software libraries. The key requirement is that we understand what is your original work and what work is based on that of other people. Therefore, you need to clearly state what you have used and where the original material can be found. Also, if you have made any changes to the original versions, you must explain what you have changed.
The main piece of thrid party software that I used is the Arduino integrated development environment.  This is a software package used to write programs, compile them and deploy them onto the arduino microcontroller series.
\\This software includes a collection of libraries to be used withe the arduino hardware to aid in the development of programs for it.  The only one of these libraries I use is for serial communication fo the sensor data base to a human readable terminal.
