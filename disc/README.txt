Daniel Atkinson Dissertation Disc

There are two main folders on this disc:
- code
- videos

There is also a pdf name "daa9_dissertation" which is a digital copy of the final report.

In the videos folder there is an index.html file, open this for a list of videos and links to them.
All of the videos are stored localy on the disc and can be found in the sub-folders inside the video folder.
All videos are in mp4 format.

In the code folder all code is in .ino format which is just C++ and as such I have packaged all the code in a  CPP folder which has the same code but as .cpp files in case the reader wants their editor fo choice to syntax highlight in C++
